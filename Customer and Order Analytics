--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--How many orders were placed in January?

--How many of those orders were for an IPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID;

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product, MIN(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, quantity, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
